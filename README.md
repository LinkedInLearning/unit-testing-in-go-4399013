The Go programming language, or Golang, includes testing support as part of its standard library.  Even though it’s up to you to think carefully about test cases, boundaries, and data structures, Golang supports programmers with a rich testing toolset and comprehensive internal package for testing. In this course, Michael Okuboyejo walks beginner/intermediate Go developers through this internal package and shows how to write, speed up, and structure unit tests in Go. Along the way, Michael offers opportunities to practice your new skills, culminating in a use case that you’ll likely encounter on the job: writing tests for HTTP clients and handlers.
